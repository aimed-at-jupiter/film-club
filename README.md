üîë Signup & API key setup
### OMDb
1.	Visit: https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx
2.	Signup for a free developer key.
3.	Put it into /server/.env.development as OMDB_API_KEY.

### Stripe
1.	 Create a Stripe account at ~[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com/)
2.	 In the Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí API keys:
	* Copy **Publishable key** ‚Üí add to /client/.env.local as VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
	* Copy **Secret key** ‚Üí add to /server/.env.development as STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
3.	 Toggle **‚ÄúView test data‚Äù** in Stripe Dashboard to run test transactions.

### üí≥ How to test payments (including on hosted site)
* Ensure your Stripe keys are **test keys** (prefix pk_test_ / sk_test_) for testing.
* Use Stripe‚Äôs test card for Checkout:

‚†Ä
### üí≥ Stripe Test Card Details

Use the following details to simulate a successful payment when testing checkout:

| Field | Test Value |
|:-|:-|
| **Card Number** | `4242 4242 4242 4242` |
| **Expiry Date** | Any future date (e.g. `12/34`) |
| **CVC** | Any 3 digits (e.g. `123`) |
| **Name** | Any name (e.g. `Jane Doe`) |
| **Email** | Any valid email (e.g. `test@example.com`) |

> üß™ **Tip:** Payments made using this test card will not charge real money.  
> You can safely use it in both local and live (test mode) environments.


‚öôÔ∏è **Running Locally**

1. ### Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/aimed-at-jupiter/film-club

2. ### Install dependencies
   Install dependencies in both directories:
   cd server
   npm install

cd ../client
npm install

3. ### Database setup (local Postgres)
   Make sure PostgreSQL is running locally, then from /server:
   npm run setup-dbs
   npm run seed
   setup-dbs creates the required databases (development, test).
   seed populates them with sample users, events, and signups.

4. ### Create environment variables (make sure you add .env* to your .gitignore)
   üóÑÔ∏è **Server** (/server/.env.development)

- DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/film_club
- JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
- OMDB_API_KEY=your_omdb_api_key
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_test_secret
- CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173

For production (.env.production), replace these with live keys and URLs.

üíª **Client** (/client/.env.local)

- VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:9090
- VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_test_public_key

For deployment (.env.production), replace with your live API URL and keys.

5. ### Start the app
Run both the server and client in separate terminals:

Terminal 1 ‚Äì backend
cd server
npm run dev

Terminal 2 ‚Äì frontend
cd client
npm run dev

Then open http://localhost:5173

üß™ Testing
To run automated backend tests:
cd server
npm test

Seeds the test database automatically
Runs Jest integration tests for database and API endpoints

üóìÔ∏è Google Calendar Integration ‚Äî Technical Note

This application provides a quick way for users to add Film Club events to their Google Calendar using a pre-filled **Google Calendar event link**.‚Ä®When clicked, the button opens a new tab with all event details pre-populated in Google Calendar, allowing the user to confirm and save the event manually.
This implementation avoids the need for OAuth authentication and sensitive scope verification by Google, offering a lightweight and privacy-friendly solution. However, this also means:
* Users **must already be signed into Google** in their browser session.
* If they are not signed in, Google will first redirect them to the login page.
* After signing in, users may need to **click the ‚ÄúAdd to Google Calendar‚Äù button again** to open the event.

This design was chosen intentionally to maintain full functionality without requiring app verification or OAuth consent screens, while still delivering a smooth experience for most users. Whilst I initially implemented the use of Google calendar API, **as of August 28, 2025, Google requires that apps requesting sensitive OAuth scopes undergo an extensive verification process before they can access user data in production capacity**. This means that only users listed as test users in your Google Cloud project's OAuth consent screen can authorize the app during development and testing. 

I have decided to leave the code for Google Calendar API integration in (although not currently being used) so you can see how I would handle that level of functionality.

Please feel free to drop me a message if you have any questions!
