🔑 Signup & API key setup
### OMDb
1.	Visit: https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx
2.	Signup for a free developer key.
3.	Put it into /server/.env.development as OMDB_API_KEY.

### Stripe
1.	 Create a Stripe account at ~[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com/)
2.	 In the Dashboard → Developers → API keys:
	* Copy **Publishable key** → add to /client/.env.local as VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
	* Copy **Secret key** → add to /server/.env.development as STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
3.	 Toggle **“View test data”** in Stripe Dashboard to run test transactions.

### 💳 How to test payments (including on hosted site)
* Ensure your Stripe keys are **test keys** (prefix pk_test_ / sk_test_) for testing.
* Use Stripe’s test card for Checkout:

⠀
### 💳 Stripe Test Card Details

Use the following details to simulate a successful payment when testing checkout:

| Field | Test Value |
|:-|:-|
| **Card Number** | `4242 4242 4242 4242` |
| **Expiry Date** | Any future date (e.g. `12/34`) |
| **CVC** | Any 3 digits (e.g. `123`) |
| **Name** | Any name (e.g. `Jane Doe`) |
| **Email** | Any valid email (e.g. `test@example.com`) |

> 🧪 **Tip:** Payments made using this test card will not charge real money.  
> You can safely use it in both local and live (test mode) environments.


⚙️ **Running Locally**

1. ### Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/aimed-at-jupiter/film-club

2. ### Install dependencies
   Install dependencies in both directories by running the following commands in your terminal from the project root (/film-club):

   first, change directory to the server directory and install dependencies by running:
   ```
   cd server
   npm install
   ```
   then change directory back to the root by running:
   ```
   cd ..
   ```
   and then change directory to the client and install the relevant dependencies there by running:
   ```
   cd client
   npm install
   ```
3. ### Create environment variables (make sure you add .env* to your .gitignore)
1. Create two `.env` files in the server directory:

   - `.env.development` for the development database
   - `.env.test` for the test database

2. Add the following variables to each file:
   🗄️ **Server**  
   (/server/.env.development)
```env
PGDATABASE=film_club
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
OMDB_API_KEY=your_omdb_api_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```
(/server/.env.test)
```env
PGDATABASE=film_club_test
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_test_secret
OMDB_API_KEY=your_omdb_api_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

add `.env.*` to your server/.gitignore file

Create one `.env` file in the client directory:

   - `.env.local`

💻 **Client**  
(/client/.env.local)
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:9090/api
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_public_key
```

add `.env.*` to your client/.gitignore file  

NOTE: this app is set to listen on port 9090. If you wish to use a different port, ensure you add '/api' to the end of your VITE_API_URL variable and also update the PORT variable in server/listen.js 

4. ### Database setup (local Postgres)
   Make sure PostgreSQL is running locally, then run the following commands from /server:
   ```
   npm run setup-dbs
   ```
   then run:
   ```
   npm run seed
   ```
   
   setup-dbs creates the required databases (development, test).
   seed populates them with sample users, events, and signups.


6. ### Start the app
Run both the server and client in separate terminals:

Terminal 1 – backend
from the project root (/film-club), run the following commands:
```
cd server
npm run dev
```
Terminal 2 – frontend
in the second terminal, from the root, run the following commands:
```
cd client
npm run dev
```
Then open http://localhost:5173

🧪 Testing
To run automated backend tests:
```
cd server
npm test
```
Seeds the test database automatically
Runs Jest integration tests for database and API endpoints

🗓️ Google Calendar Integration — Technical Note

This application provides a quick way for users to add Film Club events to their Google Calendar using a pre-filled **Google Calendar event link**.  When clicked, the button opens a new tab with all event details pre-populated in Google Calendar, allowing the user to confirm and save the event manually.
This implementation avoids the need for OAuth authentication and sensitive scope verification by Google, offering a lightweight and privacy-friendly solution. However, this also means:
* Users **must already be signed into Google** in their browser session.
* If they are not signed in, Google will first redirect them to the login page.
* After signing in, users may need to **click the “Add to Google Calendar” button again** to open the event.

This design was chosen intentionally to maintain full functionality without requiring app verification or OAuth consent screens, while still delivering a smooth experience for most users. Whilst I initially implemented the use of Google calendar API, **as of August 28, 2025, Google requires that apps requesting sensitive OAuth scopes undergo an extensive verification process before they can access user data in production capacity**. This means that only users listed as test users in your Google Cloud project's OAuth consent screen can authorize the app during development and testing. 

I have decided to leave the code for Google Calendar API integration in (although not currently being used) so you can see how I would handle that level of functionality.

Please feel free to drop me a message if you have any questions!
